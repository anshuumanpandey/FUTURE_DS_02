# Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

Hey there! 👋
This project is my **Churn Analysis Dashboard**, built using **Power BI** to understand why customers stop using a service and how companies can improve their experience.

I tried to keep this project simple, practical, and close to real business problems 😊



# 🎯 Why I Made This Project

I wanted to learn how real companies use data to answer questions like:

* Why are customers leaving? 
* Which users are most likely to churn? 
* How can we improve retention? 

So I created this dashboard to turn raw data into meaningful insights.



# What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn simply means when a user stops using a service.

Example If 100 users subscribe and 30 leave, churn rate = **30%**.

Understanding churn helps businesses grow smarter, not harder 📊



# 🛠️ Tools I Used

Here’s what I used to build this project:

* **Power BI** → For building the dashboard and visuals 📊
* **Excel / CSV Dataset** → As the data source 📁
* **DAX** → To calculate KPIs like churn rate 🧮
* **Data Cleaning** → Removing missing values and fixing formats 🔧



# Dashboard Explained (Simple Way)



## 1️⃣ KPI Cards (Top Summary)

These cards give a quick overview of performance.

* 🎵 Total Users → 4600
* 👥 Active Users → 3188
* 🚪 Churned Users → 1412
* 📉 Churn Rate → 30.70%

This helps managers quickly understand the situation without digging into data.



## 2️⃣ Filters / Slicers (Left Side)

These make the dashboard interactive.

### 💳 Payment Method Filter

Auto‑Debit, Card, UPI, Wallet
Shows how payment method affects churn.

### 🔁 Auto‑Renew Filter

Yes / No
Helps check if auto‑renew keeps customers longer.



## 3️⃣ Demographics Section 👥

Here we study churn based on user type.

### Gender Wise Churn

Compares Male vs Female active & churned users.
Helps in targeted marketing campaigns.

### Age Group Analysis

Age groups like 18‑25, 26‑35, 36‑45, 46+.
Shows which age group leaves more.



## 4️⃣ Churn Rate Analysis 📉

This part shows technical reasons behind churn.

### 📱 Device Type

Android, iOS, Web
Maybe one platform has bugs or poor experience.

### ⏳ Buffering Time

0‑1 sec to 4+ sec
Slow buffering can frustrate users.

### 📶 Network Type

5G, WiFi, 4G
Helps understand performance issues.



## 5️⃣ Genre Analysis 🎵

Shows churn by music genre like Rock, Pop, HipHop, Jazz, etc.
Useful for recommendation systems and content strategy.



## 6️⃣ Subscription Plan Analysis 💳

Compares churn in Free, Family, and Premium plans.
Shows current churn %, previous churn %, and difference.

Helps companies improve pricing or plan features.



# 📊 DAX Measures I Used

Some important calculations:

* Churn Rate = Churned Users / Total Users
* Active Users = Total Users – Churned Users
* Churn Change % = Current – Previous

These helped create the KPI cards and comparisons.



# 💡 Insights This Dashboard Can Give

* Which users are most likely to leave
* Which payment method causes more churn
* Which age group needs attention
* Whether buffering or network affects retention
* Which subscription plan is weak

Basically, it helps businesses take smarter decisions.



# 🚀 What I Learned From This Project

This project helped me practice:

* Data cleaning in Power BI
* Writing DAX formulas
* Designing clean dashboards
* Thinking like a data analyst
* Telling stories with data 📖



Thanks for checking out my work!
